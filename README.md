# ClockDock
ClockDock is a minimal, full-screen ambient clock designed to be left open. It features a pixel-block digital display, subtle background motion, curated facts, and an interactive cursor that bends the clock around it. Built as a static site with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted via GitHub Pages.
