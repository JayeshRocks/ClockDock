# ClockDock

ClockDock is a minimal, full-screen ambient clock designed to be left open.

It focuses on calm visuals, subtle motion, and intentional interaction rather than features or controls. The clock reacts to the cursor with a gravity-like distortion, while the background slowly breathes to create a quiet sense of presence.

Built as a static site with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design Philosophy

ClockDock is meant to feel like an object, not an app.

- No settings panels  
- No constant motion  
- No distractions  

The clock updates only when it needs to.  
Animations are slow and restrained.  
Interaction rewards curiosity but never demands attention.

It’s designed to sit in the background and simply exist.
